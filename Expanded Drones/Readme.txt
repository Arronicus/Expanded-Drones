What this mod does:

- Adds mk2 variants of vanilla drones with improved stats/weaponry

- Mk2 construction drones will not build faster at this time. They are quicker and less likely to die to stray fire.


Possible conflicts:

Possible naming conflict with mods seeking to add mk2 variants of vanilla drones
Mods that remove/rename entries in Loadoutrules.xml
Gateoverhaul mod by Deadair, may work if you put it after Expanded Drones in the load order.


Savegame safety:

This mod adds new drones with new engines. Users may encounter errors continuing to play a save after removing this mod. Backing up save files before playing with new mods is always reccomended. 


Troubleshooting tips:

Q. Will Expanded Drones make my game lag?
  A. No scripts are presently added. Aside from some drones that move a bit faster, users should not experience further lag

Q. Will this mod affect storage levels at wharves/docks/shipyards?
  A. Drone construction costs are very small, any effect on storage levels should be very minimal

Q. My game doesn't start up with your extension enabled!
  A. Disable Expanded Drones in your extensions list and nothing else. Does your game now load? If no, then Expanded Drones is likely not the problem.
     If yes, you may be running another extension that conflicts with mine.

Q. Expanded Drones is definitely making my game lag!
  A. Is it though? Please send me your debug log if so, and time permitting, I'll try to identify the issue.

Especially SirNukes, for troubleshooting his X4 Customizer tool with me, without which I might have died of frustration making this mod trying to 
troubleshoot errors. Also, Mewosmith for helping me with diffing.
